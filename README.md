## So Long

So Long is a 2D game project at 42 where you create a game set in a maze. The player navigates through the maze, collecting objects and avoiding obstacles to reach the exit. This project involves programming in C and using fundamental concepts such as memory management, file I/O, and game logic.

Additional features, such as enemies and a step counter, can be implemented to enhance gameplay.

Once completed, compile and launch the game to play and test your creation.

So Long is a fun project that allows you to apply your programming skills and create an interactive 2D game.
